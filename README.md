# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM
LSTM (or) Long Short Term memory is a type of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) that is use in sequence prediction applications like in the case of the Stock Market. The Stock price is a really volatile entity and are influenced by large number of factors involving investor sentiments. Hence it is relatively hard to predict the market, but with the use of LSTM me look for common stock movements before major changes in prices to determine the price of the stock in a future instance. In this model we use the past 60 days data to predict the price of the stock for the next day oo to be precise the close price for the next day. 

Here is an example Stock data -

The above graph depicts the price movement of Apple. Inc or "AAPL" in the time frame of '2010-01-01' to '2023-01-01'. With the historical data on the stock and the last 60 days data the system predict the close price of the next day.
